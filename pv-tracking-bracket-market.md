<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Tracking Bracket Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis PV Tracking Bracket</li><li>Dual Axis PV Tracking Bracket</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The PV tracking bracket market can be categorized into two types: single axis and dual axis. Single axis PV tracking brackets allow solar panels to move horizontally along one axis, either east-west or north-south, to track the sun's movement throughout the day. Dual axis PV tracking brackets, on the other hand, enable solar panels to move both horizontally and vertically, accurately following the sun's position throughout the day and maximizing solar energy generation. Both types aim to optimize solar panel efficiency by ensuring they capture as much sunlight as possible.</p></p>
