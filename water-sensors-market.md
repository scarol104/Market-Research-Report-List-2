<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Water Sensors</li><li>Non-contacting Water Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Water sensors are electronic devices used to detect the presence of water and measure its level or quantity. The market for water sensors can be categorized into two types: contact water sensors and non-contacting water sensors. Contact water sensors come into direct contact with the water and measure its conductivity or resistivity to determine its presence. On the other hand, non-contacting water sensors use techniques like ultrasonic waves or infrared sensors to analyze the reflection or absorption of the waves to detect the water level without physical contact.</p></p>
