<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photochromic Safety Glasses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Substrate Siscoloration Lens Glasses</li><li>Film-Changing Lens Glasses</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The photochromic safety glasses market consists of two types: substrate discoloration lens glasses and film-changing lens glasses. Substrate discoloration lens glasses use a chemical compound in the lens that causes it to change color when exposed to different levels of UV light. On the other hand, film-changing lens glasses have a thin film applied to the lens that reacts to UV light and alters its opacity. Both types of glasses provide protection against harmful UV rays while offering convenience and comfort to the wearer by automatically adjusting to changing light conditions.</p></p>
