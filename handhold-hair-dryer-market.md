<p><strong>The Handhold Hair Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The handhold hair dryer market can be classified into two types: centrifugal hair dryers and axial hair dryers. Centrifugal hair dryers use a spinning fan that pulls in air from the back and blows it out through the nozzle, creating a strong airflow. Axial hair dryers, on the other hand, use a series of blades that push air in a linear direction, resulting in a less forceful but more consistent airflow. Both types serve the same purpose of drying and styling hair, but they differ in the way they generate and direct the air.</p></p>
