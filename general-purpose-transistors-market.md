<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>General purpose transistors are electronic devices used to amplify or switch electronic signals and power. There are three types of general purpose transistors: NPN, NPN/PNP, and PNP. NPN transistors have a positive terminal connected to a collector, and negative terminal connected to an emitter, allowing current to flow from the collector to the emitter. NPN/PNP transistors, also known as complementary transistors, combine both NPN and PNP types in a single package. PNP transistors work opposite to NPN, with positive terminal connected to the emitter, and negative terminal connected to the collector, making current flow from the emitter to the collector.</p></p>
