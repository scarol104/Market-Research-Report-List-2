<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Glare Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tempering Process</li><li>Silk-Screen Process</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-glare glass is a specialized type of glass that reduces glare and reflection, increasing visibility and improving aesthetics. It is commonly produced through two main market types: the tempering process and the silk-screen process. The tempering process involves heating the glass and then rapidly cooling it, making it stronger and more resistant to breakage. The silk-screen process includes applying a special coating to the glass surface, which reduces glare. Additionally, there are other market types, such as the chemical etching process or the application of anti-reflective coatings, which also eliminate glare and enhance visibility.</p></p>
